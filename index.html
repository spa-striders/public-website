<p>
  We are a friendly running club based in Leamington Spa. If you want to train for a marathon, compete in races, get a
  bit fitter, or just meet some new people then browse around a bit to check out all the details of what we do, how to
  find us and what you need to know about joining.
</p>
<p>
  The club is for anyone who enjoys running. Take a look at our  <a href="{{ "/events.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">training sessions
  and events</a> to see which ones are best for you.
</p>
<p>
  If you are already running regularly then you will find plenty of runners in the club who will be able to help you
  push that bit further and faster.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, we are not able to accommodate minors in the club. If you are under 18 and wish to train with a club,
  Leamington C&AC have an excellent youth section.
