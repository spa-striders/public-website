## Etiquette

Running with the club has many benefits, but also brings responsibility – not only towards
your fellow members, but to safeguard the reputation of Spa Striders and the sport of
running in general. We hope that members will adopt the following guidelines, at least during
club organised sessions, to help us maintain a responsible and considerate environment for
everyone:

* **BE VISIBLE**: When running in the dark wear bright, highly visible, and preferably
reflective, clothing
* **KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING**: Where possible, make yourself aware of the route
from our website or check with the Session Leader beforehand
* **STAY SAFE**: Run on the pavements rather than the roads. Always stop and look
before crossing roads. If running on the road is unavoidable, face oncoming traffic
and run single file. Those at the front of the group should shout a car/bike/obstacle
warning to those behind
* **BE COURTEOUS**: Avoid running more than two abreast and be aware of other
road/pavement users, especially pedestrians and cyclists. Say "thank you" to those
who give way to you
* **LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER**: Take responsibility for the welfare and safety of your
club mates, not just yourself. Ensure that no-one is left behind, gets lost, or becomes
isolated. Check that those behind you are in sight and ok
* **DON'T DISAPPEAR**: If leaving the group before the end of the session, ensure that
other people (and preferably the Session Leader) are aware of this
* **LISTEN**: Headphones/MP3/iPods etc. are not permitted during any club session,
including track
* **CONSIDER MOBILES AND ID**: In an emergency situation, you will be grateful for them.
Carry ID (name, address, emergency contact, medical condition info) and a mobile
holding another member’s telephone number (preferably the Session Leader’s) and
ICE. Especially important for Session Leaders and backmarkers.
* **BACKMARKING**: If it’s your turn please turn up or arrange for someone else to take
your place. Ensure you know the route in advance and who the Session Leader is.
Preferably carry a mobile (see above). Run at the back of your allocated group with
the last runner
* **BE HEALTHY**: Do not run if you feel unwell, unfit or are injured. Any accidents or
injuries that occur during a club session should be reported to the Session Leader as
soon as possible after the incident
